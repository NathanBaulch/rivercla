# River CLAs

River CLAs (content license agreements):

* [Entity CLA](./entity-cla.md)
* [Individual CLA](./individual-cla.md)

This repository contains our low touch CLA solution until we can set up something more automated.

**To sign it:**

1. Read either the [entity CLA](./entity-cla.md) (if for a business entity) or [individual CLA](./individual-cla.md) (if you're not).
2. Acknowledge your agreement by opening a pull request to the signees CSV by [clicking here](https://github.com/riverqueue/cla/edit/master/signees.csv) and adding your name and GitHub username as a new line.
3. We'll merge the pull request and you're done.

CLAs were generated using [contributoragreements.org](https://contributoragreements.org/).
